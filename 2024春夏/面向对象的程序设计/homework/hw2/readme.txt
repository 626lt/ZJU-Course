You should use the following command to compile the source code:
$ g++ lab2.cpp -o lab2
Then you can run the program by using the following command:
$ ./lab2
The program will read the input file student.txt and write the output to lab2out.txt.
You can check the output in the file lab2out.txt.

note: If you want to customize the input data, make sure that each row is formatted like this:
'name course1 score1 course2 score2 course3 score3 course4 score4 course5 score5' etc
please ensure that the space is exactly one space between each data, or the program will not work correctly.
